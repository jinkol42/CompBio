# Expression of Mouse Colon Adenocarcinoma Neoantigens

RNA-sequencing data from MC-38 mouse colon adenocarcinoma cells with or without expression of neoantigen or model antigens (AdFL, Ad9mer, and gp33).
This dataset was used to quantify and identify expression of other neoantigens and tumor associated antigens found within these cells. 

Preprocessing was completed using BWA, Samtools, GATK, and Picard through interfacing with an HPC via bash.
Downstream analysis and visualization was completed using EdgeR and ggplot2 in R. 
This data is currently in a publication currently under review at Cancer Immunology Research (CIR-23-0639R)
