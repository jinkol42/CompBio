# Gasdermin E expression in Human Tumors

This is a small project completed in R to look copy number variation and RNA expression of Gasdermin E in human breast, ovarian and glioblastoma tumors.
Expression was compared against normal tissue as well as stratified by stage and grade to identify any potential correlations with increased disease severity.

All data used for these figures is courtesy of The Cancer Genome Atlas.
