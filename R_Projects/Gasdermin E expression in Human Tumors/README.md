# Gasdermin E expression in Human Tumors

This is a small project completed in R to look at expression of Gasdermin E at an RNA level and Copy Number in human breast, ovarian and glioblastoma.
Expression was compared against normal tissue as well as stratified by stage and grade to identify any potential correlations with increased disease severity.

All data used for these figures is courtesy of The Cancer Genome Atlas.
