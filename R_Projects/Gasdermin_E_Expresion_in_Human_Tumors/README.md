# Gasdermin E Expression in Human Tumors

This is a small R project looking at copy number variation and RNA expression of Gasdermin E in human breast, ovarian and glioblastoma tumors. 
Expression of RNA transcripts was also stratified by grade and stage, where applicable, to identify any changes in expression that correlate with increased disease severity.

All data is from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)
