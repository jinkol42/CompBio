## About Me
I am a Ph.D Candidate in Immunology and Cancer Biology. I'm passionate about improving our understanding of onco-immunology through next generation computational methods. 
I am constantly learning and always looking to learn a new coding language and improve.

## Projects completed in Python

## Projects completed in R
### [Gasdermin E Expression in Human Tumors](R_Projects/Gasdermin_E_Expresion_in_Human_Tumors)
This is a small R project looking at copy number variation and RNA expression of Gasdermin E in human breast, ovarian and glioblastoma tumors.
Expression of RNA transcripts was also stratified by grade and stage, where applicable, to identify any changes in expression that correlate with increased disease severity.

All data is from The Cancer Genome Atlas

### [Expression of Mouse Colon Adenocarcinoma Neoantigens](R_Projects/Mouse-Tumor-Neoantigen)

RNA-sequencing data from MC-38 mouse colon adenocarcinoma cells with or without expression of neoantigen or model antigens (AdFL, Ad9mer, and gp33). This dataset was used to quantify and identify expression of other neoantigens and tumor associated antigens found within these cells.

Preprocessing was completed using BWA, Samtools, GATK, and Picard through interfacing with an HPC via bash. Downstream analysis and visualization was completed using EdgeR and ggplot2 in R. This data is currently in a publication under review at Cancer Immunology Research (CIR-23-0639R)

### [Characterizing Senescent T cells in Anti-tumor Immunity](R_Projects/Senescence-in-T-cells)
