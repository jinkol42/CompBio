# Analysis of Human Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Immune cells

### This analysis was performed on data originally from [**Zheng et al.** published in Nature Communications in 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20019-0). In this study they examined the immune landscape of 7 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and compared to matched normal samples from each respective patient. 

### For this project I sought to perform my own scRNA-seq analysis in Python using only scverse libraries to complete the pre-processing and analysis/visualization. These included scanpy and scvi-tools to perform normalization and identification of novel cell type markers. I further expanded on this analyzing potential novel ligand-receptor interactions between Dendritic cells and T cells as well as Macrophages and T cells by employing CellPhoneDB from the [Teichmann lab](http://www.teichlab.org/) at the Sanger Institute. 

### Unfortunately the h5ad files generated during this project were too large to upload, however I am more than happy to provide them upon request via email.
